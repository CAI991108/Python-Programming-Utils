# Python Programming Utils

This repository contains the code and documentation for python utils. Below is a brief overview of each project and the tasks involved.

**pyutils_1.py** includes:
1. **Jacobian Matrix Calculation**: Implement a function to calculate the Jacobian matrix for a given vector and function.
2. **Emirp Numbers**: Write a program to find and display the first N emirp numbers.
3. **List Operations**: Implement functions to check if a number is exclusively in one of two lists and to crack a four-digit password.
4. **Recursion and Tree Structures**: Implement recursive functions and a binary search tree.
5. **Data Loading and Wrangling**: Load and clean data from a TSV file, perform data analysis, and visualize results.
6. **Stock Data Analysis**: Analyze stock data, calculate moving averages, and implement trading strategies.
7. **KNN Classifier**: Implement a KNN classifier to predict test preparation course status based on reading and writing scores.

**pyutils_2.py** includes:
1. **Dictionary Generation**: Generate a dictionary of factorials for numbers from 1 to n.
2. **Iterator Operations**: Implement a function to find the first value in an iterator that appears k times in a row.
3. **Recursive Functions**: Write recursive functions to check for adjacent 5s in a number and to find all ways k positive integers can sum to n.
4. **List Intersection**: Implement a function to find the intersection of elements in a list of lists.
5. **Sandwich Number Check**: Implement a function to check if a number contains a sandwich (a digit surrounded by two identical digits).
6. **Mint and Coin Classes**: Implement classes to simulate a mint that creates coins with specific years and calculates their worth.
7. **Portfolio Management**: Load stock data, calculate expected returns, build a covariance matrix, and design an optimal portfolio allocation.
8. **Risk Analysis**: Calculate and visualize Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for a portfolio.
9. **Linear Classification**: Use a linear classifier to predict the status of a test preparation course and evaluate its performance.
10. **Regression Analysis**: Use linear regression to study the trend of reading scores with respect to math scores.
11. **Time Series Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis on superstore sales data, including resampling and time shifting.
12. **PyTorch Exercise**: Set up PyTorch CUDA and perform basic operations.
